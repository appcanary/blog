<p>Ransomware crews are no longer satisfied <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/03/ransomware-why-hospitals-are-the-perfect-targets/">shutting down hospitals</a> and are now also going after hip tech startups. Last week, a professional crew got involved in <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mongodb-apocalypse-professional-ransomware-group-gets-involved-infections-reach-28k-servers/">ransoming MongoDB instances</a>, and some 28,000 servers were compromised and held for Bitcoin.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;attack&rdquo; is so simple it barely deserves the name. The crew scans the internet looking for open and unsecured instances of MongoDB. When they find one, they log in and steal the data. The victims must pay Bitcoin to get their data back. To save on storage costs, sometimes the crew just deletes the data without bothering to save it &mdash; and the mark ends up paying for nothing. Even honor among thieves can&rsquo;t survive the harsh realities of 21st century globalized late cyber-capitalism.</p>

<p>When reading about these attacks, there is a strong temptation blame the victim. Hospitals were at fault because of their antiquated IT departments: huge, sclerotic fiefdoms incapable of moving past Windows 98. We all know that MongoDB <a href="http://cryto.net/~joepie91/blog/2015/07/19/why-you-should-never-ever-ever-use-mongodb/">sucks</a>, and that <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/story-of-mel.html">Real Programmers</a> would never be caught dead using it. Why, they probably <em>deserved</em> to get hacked!</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t do it. As I&rsquo;ve said before, victim-blaming in security is a <a href="https://blog.appcanary.com/2016/mirai-botnet-security-broken.html">trap that must be avoided</a>. Attacks are varied and always changing; best practices can be indistinguishable from cargo cults, and default configurations seem almost designed to foil you.</p>

<p>In this case, MongoDB apparently ships without any authentication, listening to the whole wide world. No wonder so many instances got hacked!</p>

<h2 id="howto-not-get-hacked">HOWTO not get hacked</h2>

<p>Basically, you should have as little as possible accessible to the outside world. Set up a firewall. This tweet sums up the idea best:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If Postgres, MySQL, memcached, redis, etc responds to commands from outside the VPN/firewall/etc, assume you will lose your deployment.</p>&mdash; Patrick McKenzie (@patio11) <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/818728480661590018">January 10, 2017</a></blockquote>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>If you&rsquo;re anything like me, the first thought when confronted with that tweet is: &ldquo;is my firewall actually working right?&rdquo; Would you bet money that you know what ports are open on a given server in your fleet?</p>

<h3 id="enter-nmap">Enter Nmap</h3>

<p><img title="Nmap as used in The Matrix" alt="trinity using Nmap" src="//blog.appcanary.com/images/trinity_nmap.jpg" />
<em>Nmap as used in The Matrix</em></p>

<p><a href="https://nmap.org/">Nmap</a> is an incredibly powerful tool that&rsquo;s <a href="https://nmap.org/movies/">synonymous</a> with port scanning. A port scanner is a program that checks to see what network ports are open on a computer.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what scanning <a href="https://appcanary.com">appcanary.com</a> with default settings from my work computer looks like:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ nmap appcanary.com

Starting Nmap 7.12 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2017-01-16 12:57 EST
Nmap scan report for appcanary.com (45.55.197.253)
Host is up (0.030s latency).
Not shown: 993 closed ports
PORT    STATE    SERVICE
22/tcp  open     ssh
25/tcp  filtered smtp
80/tcp  open     http
135/tcp filtered msrpc
139/tcp filtered netbios-ssn
443/tcp open     https
445/tcp filtered microsoft-ds
</code></pre>

<p>You&rsquo;ll see that 22, 80, and 443 are open. This is because we listen on SSH, HTTP and HTTPS. There are also a bunch of filtered ports. This is because some router or firewall between me and appcanary is blocking that port so it&rsquo;s not clear whether it&rsquo;s open or closed. </p>

<p>Running the same scan from a random<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Digital Ocean box gives me the true result without the intermediate network filtering.</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Starting Nmap 5.21 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2017-01-16 13:04 EST
Nmap scan report for appcanary.com (45.55.197.253)

443/tcp open  https
</code></pre>

<p>Nmap has a variety of <a href="https://nmap.org/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html">scanning options</a>, but the most important thing to understand for TCP scans is the difference between SYN scanning and connect scanning.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever tried to write a port scanner (which is a great exercise in network programming and concurrency), you&rsquo;ve probably tried to write a connect scanner. A connect scanner tries to connect to a port, and closes the connection after success. Nmap&rsquo;s most popular mode is SYN scanning. In SYN scanning, you send a SYN packet initiating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#Connection_establishment">TCP handshake</a>. If you get an SYN-ACK back, the port is open, and you send a RST instead of an ACK as you would if you were actually connecting. This is &ldquo;stealthier&rdquo;, which doesn&rsquo;t matter as much for our purposes, and is more efficient. Unfortunately it requires nmap to be run as root because it needs raw access to the network interface.</p>

<p>You can specify a SYN scan with <code>nmap -sS</code>, and a connect scan with <code>nmap -sT</code>. By default nmap will prefer to do a SYN scan if it is able to.</p>

<p>By default, nmap will scan the top 1000 most common ports. You can specify a specific ports or a range with <code>-p</code>, i.e. <code>nmap -p22</code> will scan only port 22, and <code>nmap -p400-500</code> will scan ports 400 through 500. <code>nmap -p-</code> will scan the complete port range (1-65535).</p>

<h3 id="developer-port-scan-thyself">Developer, port scan thyself</h3>

<p>Regularly port scan yourself; it&rsquo;s the only way to be certain that your databases aren&rsquo;t listening to the outside world. Run Nmap against your servers, and make sure that only the ports you expect are open. </p>

<p>To make it easier, here&rsquo;s a script to do it for you. This will run Nmap, compare the output with predefined ports, and ping you on Slack if there&rsquo;s a mismatch. Run it on a cron job, so you can check on the regular.</p>

<p>Our mission is to help you do security basics right, so you can be free to worry about the hard stuff. We&rsquo;re building the <a href="https://appcanary.com">world&rsquo;s best patch management product</a> because we had a deep need for one ourselves, and it automated such a vital part of a security team&rsquo;s job.</p>

<p>When I started writing this article, I didn&rsquo;t realize how well it fit into what we&rsquo;re doing with patch management. To do security right, you need to implement systems and continuously verify they are working correctly. <a href="https://appcanary.com">Appcanary</a> helps you verify your patch management program, the script above helps you verify your firewall. Both without any bullshit.</p>

<p>Some physicists 28 years ago needed a way to easily share experimental data and
thus the web was born.  This was generally considered to be a good move.
Unfortunately, everything physicists touch &mdash; from trigonometry to the
strong nuclear force &mdash; eventually becomes weaponized and so too has the
Hypertext Transfer Protocol. </p>

<p>What can be attacked must be defended, and since tradition requires all security
features to be a bolted-on afterthought, thingsâ€¦ got a little complicated. </p>

<p>This article explains what secure headers are and how to implement these headers
in Rails, Django, //blog.appcanary.com/tag/Express.js, Go, Nginx, and Apache.</p>

<p>Please note that some
headers may be best configured in on your HTTP servers, while others should be
set on the application layer. Use your own discretion here. You can test how well you&rsquo;re doing with Mozilla&rsquo;s

<h2 id="x-xss-protection">X-XSS-Protection</h2>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>X-XSS-Protection: 0;
X-XSS-Protection: 1;
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
</code></pre>

<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>

<p>Cross Site Scripting, commonly abbreviated XSS, is an attack where the attacker
causes a page to load some malicious javascript.  <code>X-XSS-Protection</code> is a
feature in Chrome and Internet Explorer that is designed to protect against
&ldquo;reflected&rdquo; XSS attacks &mdash; where an attacker is sending the malicious
payload as part of the request<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p><code>X-XSS-Protection: 0</code> turns it off.<br/>
<code>X-XSS-Protection: 1</code> will filter out scripts that came from the request - but
will still render the page<br/> 
<code>X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block</code> when triggered, will block the whole page from being rendered.</p>

<h3 id="should-i-use-it">Should I use it?</h3>

<p>Yes. Set <code>X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block</code>. The &ldquo;filter bad scripts&rdquo; mechanism is problematic; see <a href="http://blog.innerht.ml/the-misunderstood-x-xss-protection/">here</a> for why.</p>

<h2 id="content-security-policy">Content Security Policy</h2>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Content-Security-Policy: &lt;policy&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>

<p>Content Security Policy can be thought of as much more advanced version of the
<code>X-XSS-Protection</code> header above. While <code>X-XSS-Protection</code> will block scripts
that come from the request, it&rsquo;s not going to stop an XSS attack that involves
storing a malicious script on your server or loading an external resource with a
malicious script in it.</p>

<p>CSP gives you a language to define where the browser can load resources from.
You can white list origins for scripts, images, fonts, stylesheets, etc in a very
granular manner. You can also compare any loaded content against a hash or
signature.</p>

<h3 id="should-i-use-it">Should I use it?</h3>

<p>Yes. It won&rsquo;t prevent all XSS attacks, but it&rsquo;s a significant mitigation against
their impact, and an important aspect of defense-in-depth. That said, it can be
hard to implement. If you&rsquo;re an intrepid reader and went ahead and checked the
headers <a href="https://appcanary.com">appcanary.com</a> returns<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, you&rsquo;ll see that we don&rsquo;t
have CSP implemented yet. There are some rails development plugins we&rsquo;re using
that are holding us back from a CSP implementation that will have an actually security impact.
We&rsquo;re working on it, and will write about it in the next instalment!</p>

<h3 id="how">How?</h3>

<p>Writing a CSP policy can be challenging.
See
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy">here</a> for
a list of all the directives you can employ. A good place to start
is <a href="https://csp.withgoogle.com/docs/adopting-csp.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>

<p>When we want to securely communicate with someone, we face two problems. The
first problem is privacy; we want to make sure the messages we send can only
be read by the recipient, and no one else. The other problem is that of
authentication: how do we know the recipient is who they say they are?</p>

<p>HTTPS solves the first problem with encryption, though it has some major issues
with authentication (more on this later, see <a href="#http-public-key-pinning-hpkp">Public Key
Pinning</a>). The HSTS header solves the
meta-problem: how do you know if the person you&rsquo;re talking to actually supports
encryption?</p>

<p>HSTS mitigates an attack called
<a href="https://moxie.org/software/sslstrip/">sslstrip</a>. Suppose you&rsquo;re using a hostile
network, where a malicious attacker controls the wifi router. The attacker can
disable encryption between you and the websites you&rsquo;re browsing. Even if the
site you&rsquo;re accessing is only available over HTTPS, the attacker can
man-in-the-middle the HTTP traffic and make it look like the site works over
unencrypted HTTP. No need for SSL certs, just disable the encryption.</p>

<p>Enter the HSTS. The <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code> header solves this by letting
your browser know that it must always use encryption with your site. As long as
your browser has seen an HSTS header &mdash; and it hasn&rsquo;t expired &mdash; it
will not access the site unencrypted, and will error out if it&rsquo;s not available
over HTTPS.</p>

<h3 id="should-i-use-it">Should I use it?</h3>

<p>Yes. Your app is only available over HTTPS, right? Trying to browse over regular
old HTTP will redirect to the secure site, right? (Hint: Use
<a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">letsencrypt</a> if you want to avoid the racket that are
commercial certificate authorities.)</p>

<p>The one downside of the HSTS header is that it allows for a <a href="http://www.radicalresearch.co.uk/lab/hstssupercookies">clever
technique</a> to create
supercookies that can fingerprint your users. As a website operator, you
probably already track your users somewhat - but try to only use HSTS for good
and not for supercookies.</p>

<h3 id="how">How?</h3>

<p>The two options are</p>

<ul>
<li><code>includeSubDomains</code> - HSTS applies to subdomains</li>
<li><code>preload</code> - Google maintains a <a href="https://hstspreload.appspot.com/">service</a>
that hardcodes<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> your site as being HTTPS only into browsers. This
way, a user doesn&rsquo;t even have to visit your site: their browser already knows
it should reject unencrypted connections.
Getting off that list is hard, by the way, so only turn it on if you know you
can support HTTPS forever on all your subdomains.</li>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Public-Key-Pins: pin-sha256=&lt;base64==&gt;; max-age=&lt;expireTime&gt;;
Public-Key-Pins: pin-sha256=&lt;base64==&gt;; max-age=&lt;expireTime&gt;; includeSubDomains
Public-Key-Pins: pin-sha256=&lt;base64==&gt;; max-age=&lt;expireTime&gt;; report-uri=&lt;reportURI&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>

<p>The HSTS header described above was designed to ensure that all connections to your
website are encrypted. However, nowhere does it specify what key to use! </p>

<p>Trust on the
web is based on the certificate authority (CA) model. Your browser and operating system
ship with the public keys of some trusted certificate authorities which are
usually specialized companies and/or nation states. When a CA issues you a
certificate for a given domain that means anyone who trusts that CA will
automatically trust the SSL traffic you encrypt using that certificate.  The CAs
are responsible for verifying that you actually own a domain (this can be
anything from sending an email, to asking you to host a file, to investigating
your company).</p>

<p>Two CAs can issue a certificate for the same domain to two different people, and
browsers will trust both. This creates a problem, especially since CAs <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/2524375">can be
and are</a> compromised.
This allows attackers to MiTM any domain they want, even if that domain uses SSL
&amp; HSTS!</p>

<p>The HPKP header tries to mitigate this. This header lets you to &ldquo;pin&rdquo; a
certificate. When a browser sees the header for the first time, it will save the
certificate. For every request up to <code>max-age</code>, the browser will fail unless at
least one certificate in the chain sent from the server has a fingerprint that
was pinned.</p>

<p>This means that you can pin to the CA or a intermediate certificate along with
the leaf in order to not shoot yourself in the foot (more on this later).</p>

<p>Much like HSTS above, the HPKP header also has some privacy implications.
These were laid out in the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7469#section-5">RFC</a>
itself.</p>

<h3 id="should-i-use-it">Should I use it?</h3>

<p>Probably not. </p>

<p>HPKP is a very very sharp knife. Consider this: if you pin to the wrong
certificate, or you lose your keys, or something else goes wrong, you&rsquo;ve locked
your users out of your site. All you can do is wait for the pin to expire.</p>

<p>This
<a href="https://blog.qualys.com/ssllabs/2016/09/06/is-http-public-key-pinning-dead">article</a>
lays out the case against it, and includes a fun way for attackers to use HPKP
to hold their victims ransom.</p>

<p>One alternative is using the <code>Public-Key-Pins-Report-Only</code> header, which will
just report that something went wrong, but not lock anyone out. This allows you
to at least know your users are being MiTMed with fake certificates.</p>

<h3 id="how">How?</h3>

<p>The two options are</p>

<ul>
<li><code>includeSubDomains</code> - HPKP applies to subdomains</li>
<li><code>report-uri</code> - Inavlid attempts will be reported here</li>
</ul>

<p>You have to generate a base64 encoded fingerprint for the key you pin to, and
you <strong>have</strong> to use a backup key.  Check <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Public_Key_Pinning#Extracting_the_Base64_encoded_public_key_information">this
guide</a>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM https://example.com/
</code></pre>

<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>

<p>Before we started giving dumb names to vulnerabilities, we used to give dumb
names to hacking techniques. &ldquo;Clickjacking&rdquo; is one of those dumb names. </p>

<p>The idea goes like this: you create an invisible iframe, place it in focus and
route user input into it. As an attacker, you can then trick people into playing
a browser-based game while their clicks are being registered by a hidden iframe
displaying twitter - forcing them to non-consensually retweet all of your
tweets.</p>

<p>It sounds dumb, but it&rsquo;s an effective attack.</p>

<h3 id="should-i-use-it">Should I use it?</h3>

<p>Yes. Your app is a beautiful snowflake. Do you really want some
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/08/annotate-this/">genius</a> shoving it into an
iframe so they can vandalize it?</p>

<h3 id="how">How?</h3>

<p><code>X-Frame-Options</code> has three modes, which are pretty self explanatory.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>DENY</code> - No one can put this page in an iframe</li>
<li><code>SAMEORIGIN</code> - The page can only be displayed in an iframe by someone on the same origin.</li>
<li><code>ALLOW-FROM</code> - Specify a specific url that can put the page in an iframe</li>
</ul>

<p>One thing to remember is that you can stack iframes as deep as you want, and in
that case, the behavior of <code>SAMEORIGIN</code> and <code>ALLOW-FROM</code> isn&rsquo;t
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7034#section-2.3.2.2">specified</a>. That is, if we
have a triple-decker iframe sandwich and the innermost iframe has <code>SAMEORIGIN</code>,
do we care about the origin of the iframe around it, or the topmost one on the
page? Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯.</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff;
</code></pre>

<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>

<p>The problem this header solves is called &ldquo;MIME sniffing&rdquo;, which is actually a
browser &ldquo;feature&rdquo;. </p>

<p>In theory, every time your server responds to a request it is supposed to set a
<code>Content-Type</code> header in order to tell the browser if it&rsquo;s getting some HTML, a
cat gif, or a Flash cartoon from 2008. Unfortunately, the web has always been
broken and has never really followed a spec for anything; back in the day lots
of people didn&rsquo;t bother to set the content type header properly. </p>

<p>As a result, browser vendors decided they should be really helpful and try to
infer the content type by inspecting the content itself while completely ignore
the content type header.  If it looks like a gif, display a gif!, even though
the content type is <code>text/html</code>.  Likewise, if it looks like we got some HTML,
we should render it as such even if the server said it&rsquo;s a gif.</p>

<p>This is great, except when you&rsquo;re running a photo-sharing site, and users can
upload photos that look like HTML with javascript included, and suddenly you
have a stored XSS attack on your hand.</p>

<p>The <code>X-Content-Type-Options</code> headers exist to tell the browser to shut up and
set the damn content type to what I tell you, thank you.</p>

<h3 id="should-i-use-it">Should I use it?</h3>

<p>Yes, just make sure to set your content types correctly.</p>

<p>Ah, the <code>Referer</code> header. Great for analytics, bad for your users&rsquo; privacy. At

it all the time. And while we&rsquo;re at it, let&rsquo;s spell &ldquo;Referrer&rdquo;
correctly<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The <code>Referrer-Policy</code> header allows you to specify when the browser will set a
<code>Referer</code> header.</p>

<h3 id="should-i-use-it">Should I use it?</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s up to you, but it&rsquo;s probably a good idea. If you don&rsquo;t care about your

yourself and out of your competitors&rsquo; grubby hands.</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Set-Cookie: &lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;; Expires=&lt;expiryDate&gt;; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=strict
</code></pre>

<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t a security header per se, but there are three different options for
cookies that you should be aware of.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Cookies marked as <code>Secure</code> will only be served over HTTPS. This prevents
someone from reading the cookies in a MiTM attack where they can force the
browser to visit a given page.</p></li>
<li><p><code>HttpOnly</code> is a misnomer, and has nothing to do with HTTPS (unlike <code>Secure</code>
above). Cookies marked as <code>HttpOnly</code> can not be accessed from within
javascript. So if there is an XSS flaw, the attacker can&rsquo;t immediately steal
the cookies.</p></li>
<li><p><code>SameSite</code> helps defend against Cross-Origin Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
This is an attack where a different website the user may be visiting
inadvertently tricks them into making a request against your site, i.e. by
including an image to make a GET request, or using javascript to submit a form
for a POST request. Generally, people defend against this
using
<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet">CSRF tokens</a>.
A cookie marked as <code>SameSite</code> won&rsquo;t be sent to a different site.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It has two modes, lax and strict. Lax mode allows the cookie to be sent in a
  top-level context for GET requests (i.e. if you clicked a link). Strict
  doesn&rsquo;t send any third-party cookies.</p>

<h3 id="should-i-use-it">Should I use it?</h3>

<p>You should absolutely set <code>Secure</code> and <code>HttpOnly</code>. Unfortunately, as of writing,
SameSite cookies are <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=samesite">available</a> only in
Chrome and Opera, so you may want to ignore them for now.</p>

<section class='post-content'>
<p>Last week, we got a strange support request. One of our users had received the following notification:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey! Good job.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve detected that you patched some vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what changed:</p>

<p><a href="https://appcanary.com/vulns/46220">CVE-2016-8704</a></p>

<p>is no longer present in:</p>

<p>[name of server redacted]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This came as a surprise, since they knew for a fact that no one had touched the package in
question, and they were certain they had not enabled unattended upgrades. </p>

<p>Somehow, the vulnerability magically got patched and they wanted to
know: what&rsquo;s going on?</p>

<p>The vuln is a pretty serious remote code execution vulnerability in <code>memcached</code>,
and as far as we could tell our user was indeed using the most recent version available for their
distribution &mdash; <code>1.4.25-2ubuntu2.1</code>. This version was released on November 3rd, and we could see from our logs that
<code>memcached</code> got upgraded that same day.</p>

<p>How did it happen without them knowing about it? The only thing unique about
their configuration was that they&rsquo;re running the recently released Ubuntu 16.10 (Yakkety
Yak)<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. </p>

<p>We dug around, and set up some test Yakkety boxes, and
lo and behold: unattended upgrades is automatically enabled by default!</p>

<p>For those of you who are unaware, <code>unattended-upgrades</code> is a debian/ubuntu package that, well, does what it says on the
tin: it automatically upgrades your packages. The most common configuration, and the one enabled in 16.10, is to upgrade any packages that have a published security patch. Unattended upgrades does this by checking and installing any
updates from the <code>${distro_codename}-security</code> repository.</p>

<p>Ubuntu/debian has had this for years, but it simply was never turned on by
default. After a year of many
<a href="https://blog.appcanary.com/2016/vikhal-symantec.html">security</a>
<a href="https://blog.appcanary.com/2016/mirai-botnet-security-broken.html">fails</a>, this
news warmed the cockles of my heart and gave me hope for our future! And what&rsquo;s
even amazing is that they turned it on without any fanfare. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the quiet,
simple changes that provide the biggest wins.</p>

<p>Of course, there are reasons why administrators don&rsquo;t always want software to be upgraded without
their input. And if it does get updated, there are good reasons for knowing exactly what vulnerabilities are being patched when.
<a href="https://appcanary.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=unattended">Appcanary</a> exists in order to allow you to be notified
about security updates without automatically installing them, and to have
insight into what&rsquo;s going being installed if you are patching automatically.</p>

<p>But if you don&rsquo;t have the capacity to actively manage the packages on your
linux systems (and even if you do!), we implore you: set up <code>unattended-upgrades</code>!</p>

<p>Ubuntu enabling this by default is a great sign for the future.</p>

<section class='post-content'>
<p>On October 11th, Appcanary relied on about 8,500 lines of clojure code. On the
12th we were down to zero. We replaced it by adding another 5,700 lines of Ruby to our codebase. 
<a href="https://twitter.com/phillmv">Phill</a> will be discussing why we left, and what we learned both here and <a href="http://rubyconf.org/program#prop_19">at this year&rsquo;s RubyConf</a>. For now, I want to talk about what I&rsquo;ll miss.</p>

<h3 id="1-the-joy-of-lisp">1) The joy of Lisp</h3>

<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/297/"><img alt="XKCD #297" src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/lisp_cycles.png" /></a></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s something magical about writing lisp. Alan Kay called it the greatest
single programming language ever devised. Paul Graham called it a
secret weapon. You can find tens of thousands
of words on the elegant, mind-expanding powers of lisp<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I don&rsquo;t think
my version of the Lisp wizardry blog post would be particularly original or
unique, so if you want to know more about the agony and ecstasy of wielding
parenthesis, read <a href="http://paulgraham.com/avg.html">Paul Graham</a>.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s great about Clojure is that while Ruby
<a href="http://www.randomhacks.net/2005/12/03/why-ruby-is-an-acceptable-lisp/">might be an acceptable lisp</a>,
and lisp might
<a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.ca/2006/04/lisp-is-not-acceptable-lisp.html">not be an acceptable lisp</a>,
Clojure is a more than acceptable lisp. If we avoid the minefield of type
systems, Clojure addresses the other 4 problems Steve Yegge discusses in the previous link<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="2-immutability">2) Immutability</h3>

<p>The core data structures in clojure are immutable. If I define <code>car</code> to be <code>&quot;a dirty van&quot;</code>,
nothing can ever change that. I can name some other thing <code>car</code> later, but
anything referencing that first <code>car</code> will always be referencing <code>&quot;a dirty van&quot;</code>.</p>

<p>This is great for a host of reasons. For one, you get parallelization for free &mdash;
since nothing will mutate your collection, mapping or reducing some function
over it can be hadooped out to as many clouds as you want without changing your
algorithms.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also much easier to can reason about your code. There&rsquo;s a famous quote by Larry Wall:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Perl] would prefer that you stayed out of its living room because you weren&rsquo;t
invited, not because it has a shotgun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was talking about private methods, but the same is true for mutability in most languages. You call some method and who knows if it mutated a value you were using? You would prefer it not to, but you have no shotgun, and frankly it&rsquo;s so easy to mutate state without even knowing that you are. Consider Python:</p>
<pre class="highlight python"><code><span class="n">str1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"My name "</span>
<span class="n">str2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">str1</span>
<span class="n">str1</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="s">"is Max"</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">str1</span>
<span class="c"># "My name is Max"</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">str2</span>
<span class="c"># "My name"</span>

<span class="n">list1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">list2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">list1</span>
<span class="n">list1</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">list1</span>
<span class="c"># [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">list2</span>
<span class="c"># [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Calling <code>+=</code> on a string returned a new one, while calling <code>+=</code> on a list
mutated it in place! I have to remember which types are mutable, and whether
<code>+=</code> will give me a new object or mutate the existing one depending on its type.
Who knows what might happen when you start passing your variables by reference
to somewhere else?</p>

<p>Not having the choice to mutate state is as liberating as getting rid of your Facebook account.</p>

<h3 id="3-data-first-programming">3) Data first programming</h3>

<p>Walking away from object-oriented languages is very freeing. </p>

<p>I want to design a model for the game of poker. I start by listing the
nouns<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>: &ldquo;card&rdquo;, &ldquo;deck&rdquo;, &ldquo;hand&rdquo;, &ldquo;player&rdquo;, &ldquo;dealer&rdquo;, etc. Then I
think of the verbs, &ldquo;deal&rdquo;, &ldquo;bet&rdquo;, &ldquo;fold&rdquo;, etc. </p>

<p>Now what?
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19553838/oop-design-quesiton-with-a-card-game">Here&rsquo;s</a>
a typical StackOverflow question demonstrating the confusion that comes with
designing like this. Is the dealer a kind of player or a separate class? If
players have hands of cards, how does the deck keep track of what cards are
left? </p>

<p>At the end of the day, the work of programming a poker game is codifying all of
the actual rules of the game, and these will end up in a <code>Game</code> singleton that
does most of the work anyway. </p>

<p>If you start by thinking about data and the functions that operate on it,
there&rsquo;s a natural way to solve hard problems from the top-down, which lets you quickly iterate your
design (see below). You have some data structure that represents the game
state, a structure representing possible actions a player can take, and a
function to transform a game state and an action into the next game state. That
function encodes the actual rules of poker (defined in lots of other, smaller
functions).</p>

<p>I find this style of programming very natural and satisfying. Of course, you can
do this in any language; but I find Clojure draws me towards it, while OO
languages push me away from it.</p>

<h3 id="4-unit-testing">4) Unit Testing</h3>

<p>The majority of your code is made up of pure functions. A pure function is one
which always gives the same output for a given input &mdash; doesn&rsquo;t that sound
easy to test? Instead of setting up test harnesses databases and mocks, you just
write tests for your functions.</p>

<p>Testing the edges of your code that talk to the outside world requires mocking,
of course, and integration testing is never trivial. But the first thing you want to
test is the super-complicated piece of business logic deep in your
codebase. The business logic your business depends on, like for instance computing
whether your version of OpenSSL is vulnerable to HeartBleed. </p>

<p>Clojure pushes you
to make that bit of code a pure function that&rsquo;s testable without setting
up complicated state.</p>

<h3 id="5-refactoring">5) Refactoring</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a typical clojure function</p>
<pre class="highlight clojure"><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">defn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="c1">;; some code here
</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">some-function</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">a</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)]</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="c1">;; a ton of 
</span><span class="w">    </span><span class="c1">;; complicated code here
</span><span class="p">)))</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre>

<p>In lisp-speak, a parenthesized block is called a &ldquo;form&rdquo;. The <code>foo</code> form is the outer form, and it contains the <code>let</code> form, which ostensibly contains other forms that do complicated things.</p>

<p>I know that all the complicated code inside of the <code>let</code> form isn&rsquo;t going to
mutate any state, and that it&rsquo;s only dependent on the <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> variables. This means that
refactoring this code out into its own functions is as trivial as selecting
everything between two matching parentheses and cutting and pasting it out. If
you have an editor that supports paredit-style navigation of lisp forms, you can
rearrange code at lightning speed.</p>

<p>My favourite essay of this ilk is Mark Tarver&rsquo;s melancholy

<p>Recently I spent a couple of hours banging my head against code that looks like this:</p>
<pre class="highlight clojure"><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">defn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">parse-file</span><span class="w">

</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">defn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">check</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">file</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">kind</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">try+</span><span class="w">

        </span><span class="err">â€¦</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">etc</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre>

<p>And much to my surprise, I kept getting the kind of exception <code>parse-file</code> generates deep within the <code>check</code> function, right up against <code>(not-empty artifacts)</code>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve grown somewhat used to Clojure exceptions being unhelpful, but this was taking the cake. Coming from Ruby and pretty much every other language, this brushed up rudely against my expectations. </p>

<p>You can tell that exceptions in Clojure are unloved, given how cumbersome handling them natively is. We&rsquo;d had some trouble in the past getting <a href="https://github.com/scgilardi/slingshot">slingshot</a> to behave properly, so I zero&#39;ed in on there. Don&rsquo;t all exceptions in Java descend from <code>Exception</code>?</p>

<p>Stepping through <code>check</code> in the <a href="cursive-ide.com">Cursive</a> debugger, I could see that the exception generated was a pure java exception, not a slingshot exception generated by <code>throw+</code> in <code>consume-manifest</code>. This meant that the exception was slipping straight through uncaught. But calling <code>consume-manifest</code> directly in my repl was causing it to work as intended.</p>

<p>What the hell was going on?</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mveytsman">Max</a> took one look at it and set me straight. &ldquo;Oh. <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/remove"><code>remove</code></a> is lazy, so the exception isn&rsquo;t being throw until the lazy sequence is accessed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Excuse me? I had an angry expression on my face. He looked sheepish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How else would a lazy data structure work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well. I would expect a <code>catch java.lang.Exception</code> to <em>catch every exception</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right, well, hear me out. What if you had the following Ruby?&rdquo;</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">lazy_parse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="no">File</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">each_line</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">each_with_index</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">lazy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">map</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">line</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">|</span>
    <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="s2">"You can't catch me, I'm the exception man"</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">5</span>
    <span class="n">line</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">consume_file</span>
  <span class="k">begin</span>
    <span class="n">lazy_parse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Gemfile.lock"</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">rescue</span>
    <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Woops, an exception. Good thing we caught it."</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="n">file</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">consume_file</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">file</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">first</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>(Did you know that Ruby has had <a href="http://railsware.com/blog/2012/03/13/ruby-2-0-enumerablelazy/">lazy enumerables</a> for almost four years now? Worth reading <a href="http://patshaughnessy.net/2013/4/3/ruby-2-0-works-hard-so-you-can-be-lazy">Shaughnessy as well</a>.)</p>

<p>That shut me up good. And in case you were wondering, the stack trace is also useless in Ruby; there simply isn&rsquo;t any context for it to preserve. Frankly, I&rsquo;ve just never had to think about lazy data structures in Rubyland; they&rsquo;ve not been super popular. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to reason about this. I want to write wrapper functions that make my code safe to consume downstream. This isn&rsquo;t feasible for any functions iterating over potentially infinite lazy sequences, but fortunately for us we need to fit this file into memory anyways. In Ruby we&rsquo;d have to forcibly iterate over every element of the sequence and check for exceptions, but Clojure makes this easy with <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/doall"><code>doall</code></a>:</p>
<pre class="highlight clojure"><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">defn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">parse-file</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">contents</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">doall</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">remove</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">nil?</span><span class="w">
                 </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">code-that</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">throws-an-exception</span><span class="p">))))</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre>

<p>And now, things behave as intended.</p>
