I'm excited to announce that Appcanary now fully supports **Debian**. If you
install our agent on a Debian server, we will email you notifications whenever
any package you have installed on your system has a known vulnerability. We track over 24,000 vulnerabilities already!

You can also use our [Check API](https://appcanary.com/docs#check-endpoint) to
verify if your Debian server has any vulnerable packages, and our
[Monitor API](https://appcanary.com/docs#create-monitor) to register to receive
notifications if a set of Debian packages ever has new vulnerabilities.


If you're not a current user and want to try out Appcanary for Debian, you can
[sign up](https://appcanary.com/signup)!


You can always let us know what you think at
[hello@appcanary.com](mailto:hello@appcanary.com).
