refactoring this code out into it's own functions is as trivial as selecting
everything between two matching parentheses and cutting and pasting it out. If
you have an editor that supports paredit-style navigation of lisp forms, you can
rearrange code at lightning speed.

[^bipolar]: My favourite essay of this ilk is Mark Tarver's melancholy
  [The Bipolar Lisp Programmer](http://www.shenlanguage.org/lambdassociates/htdocs/blog/bipolar.htm).
  He describes lisp as a language designed by and for brilliant failures. Back
  in university, I ate this shit up. My grades were obvious evidence of half the
  requirement of being a lisp programmer.

[^hygenic]: I'm aware that clojure's `gensym` does not a hygenic macro system
    make. But, if you have strong opinions on hygenic macros as they relate to
    acceptable lisps, this article might not be for you.

[^nouns]: For the record, I know that this isn't the "right" way to design OO
    programs, but the fact that I have to acknowledge this proves my point.
