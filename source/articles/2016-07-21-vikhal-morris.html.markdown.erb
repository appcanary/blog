Welcome to the second installment of [Vulnerabilities I Have Known and Loved](http://blog.appcanary.com/tag/vihkal.html), our series profiling the history of interesting security vulnerabilities.

Paranoia is natural for security practitioners. Hacking can feel like a
something you learned when you were initiated into a secret society of wizards.
Once you're initiated, you get access to this
[addictive drug](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Sv8IHkBtBEXjSW7WktEYg4EbAUHtVyXIZBrAGD3WR5Y/edit?pref=2&pli=1#slide=id.p)
that gives you super powers. But there are other wizards out there, some good
but many who practice black magic. And the NSA's school of magic has a seemingly
unlimited budget. It's natural to get a little paranoid. Experience shows you
that with the right incantation you can turn crashes into working exploits. It
follows that every time your computer crashes, it could be someone in the
shadows, chanting the right incantation. The paranoia can be all-consuming. Of
course, as
[Hemingway's life shows](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/02/opinion/02hotchner.html?_r=0),
just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they aren't out to get you.

In October 2013, a well known computer security expert named Dragos Ruiu came
out publicly with a [story](http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/10/meet-badbios-the-mysterious-mac-and-pc-malware-that-jumps-airgaps/). He found that his computers had been behaving oddly,
and the symptoms he was seeing were impossible to eradicate. This was some kind of worm, because the behavior would
replicate across computers [air gapped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_gap_(networking)) computers in his lab. He theorized that he
was infected with a super advanced piece of malware that lived in the BIOS and
would spread across air gaps by sending ultrasonic frequencies from speaker to
microphone, undetectable to the human ear. He dubbed it BadBIOS. It looked like
the work of the NSA or someone equally omnipotent.

Everything that was claimed about BadBIOS is possible, and most security folks know this. Actually, as a consequence of the hype, [many](https://github.com/Katee/quietnet) [people](https://www.anfractuosity.com/projects/ultrasound-networking/) came out with ultrasound networking libraries to demonstrate just how possible it is. Malware in the BIOS is possible, and beyond being a [research](https://www.wired.com/2015/03/researchers-uncover-way-hack-bios-undermine-secure-operating-systems/) topic, it's something we [know](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/02/the_equation_gr.html) the [NSA does](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/catalog-reveals-nsa-has-back-doors-for-numerous-devices-a-940994.html).

Dragos Ruiu imaged his computer and made a lot of data available to the
community for peer review, but unfortunately no credible[^credible] researcher has publicly confirmed his findings. Maybe there was something going on. Maybe he was seeing patterns in the noise. Either way, it says something about the world today that when you're a security expert and your computer starts behaving weirdly, the obvious culprit is the NSA.

It made me think of a different worm, in a more innocent time.

![Morris Worm](images/morris_worm.jpg)
# The Morris Worm

It's November 2nd 1988, almost exactly 25 years before BadBIOS became a
hashtag. Robert Tappan Morris, a graduate student at Cornell, executes some
code he'd been working on and goes to dinner. The aftermath was a
self-replicating computer worm that infected 10% of the Internet[^internet] at
the time &mdash; a whopping 6,000 computers!

Morris claimed that he wrote his program to map the size of the Internet. And
indeed, each infection would send a byte to a machine in Berkeley
(further hiding the trail to Morris from Cornell as the author). Unfortunately,
there was a bug that caused it to propagate too aggressively and infect the same
computer multiple times, which resulted in a denial of service attack across the
whole Internet. Furthermore, the code to report infection had a bug in it. It tried to
send a UDP packet over a TCP socket, making it useless for reporting the Internet's size.

An alternative explanation is that Morris was trying to bring to wider attention
some long-standing bugs in the Internet. As Morris' friend and future co-founder
Paul Graham[^graham] [put it](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/07/us/computer-invasion-back-door-ajar.html) in classic pg style:

> Mr. Graham, who has known the younger Mr. Morris for several years, compared
> his exploit to that of Mathias Rust, the young German who flew light plane
> through Soviet air defenses in May 1987 and landed in Moscow.

> "It's as if [Mathias Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathias_Rust) had not just flown into Red Square, but built
> himself a stealth bomber by hand and then flown into Red Square," he said.

## What did the Morris Worm actually do?

The Morris Worm[^worm] exploited three separate vulnerabilities. It guessed
passwords for rsh/rexec, it exploited a debug-mode backdoor in sendmail and it used "one
very neat trick." I'll go over each of these in detail, and you can see an archive (decompiled and commented) code for yourself [here](https://github.com/arialdomartini/morris-worm).

### Rsh and Rexec

`rsh` and `rexec` are remote shell protocols from the BSD era that are almost
unused today, having been supplanted by `ssh`. `rsh` can allow passwordless
authentication if coming from a "trusted" host. The file `/etc/hosts.equiv` and
per-user `.rhosts` files contain a list of addresses of trusted hosts. When an
`rsh` request comes from a user of a trusted machine, the user is automatically
granted access. The worm used this to propagate, searching for trusted hosts in
the above two files and in `.forward` which was used to forward your mail around
the Internet.

Even in 1988, people knew that leaving `rsh` open on an untrusted network like
the the Internet was a Bad Idea, and the worm also propogated via `rexec`.
`rexec` uses password authentication, but Morris made the intelligent assumption
that one person's accounts on different machines will share a password.
Back then, `/etc/passwd` would often[^shadow] store the encrypted user password. The
worm shipped with an optimized implementation of
[`crypt`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypt_(Unix)) and a dictionary used for
cracking local passwords. If it managed to crack a password it would try to log
in to likely hosts with it.

### Sendmail

The Morris Worm exploited an
[apparently deliberate](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/07/us/computer-invasion-back-door-ajar.html)
backdoor in Sendmail. Sendmail had a "debug" mode, that allowed you to route an
email to any process, including shell! Ironically, it was left as a backdoor to
get around annoying sysadmins that were too paranoid to give the author too much access.

> Eric Allman, a computer programmer who designed the mail program that Morris
> exploited, said yesterday that he created the back door to allow him to fine
> tune the program on a machine that an overzealous administrator would not give
> him access to. He said he forgot to remove the entry point before the program
> was widely distributed in 1985.

Sendmail used to have another similar backdoor called "wizard mode", where sending the strings "WIZ" and "SHELL" gave you a root shell. By the time that Morris was writing his worm wizard mode was disabled almost everywhere.

If you're wondering how sendmail could have backdoors like this, it seems that it was somewhat well known. This quote from a [mail](http://securitydigest.org/tcp-ip/archive/1988/11) by [Paul Vixie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Vixie) summarizes the situation.

# the hole [in sendmail] was so obvious that i surmise that Morris
# was not the only one to discover it.  perhaps other less
# reproductively minded arpanetters have been having a field
# 'day' ever since this bsd release happened. 

I've known about it for a long time.  I thought it was common knowledge
and that the Internet was just a darned polite place.  (I think it _was_
common knowledge among the people who like to diddle the sendmail source.)

The bug in fingerd was a big surprise, though.  Overwriting a stack frame
on a remote machine with executable code is One Very Neat Trick.

The Internet was a polite place indeed! 

### One Very Neat Trick

The very neat trick that Vixie was talking about is a now-standard
[stack buffer overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow)! It's
fascinating to read contemporary accounts that marvel at the cleverness of a class of
bugs that are now ubiquitous &mdash; although, for me at least, they still haven't
lost their magic[^magic].

Here's the main routine from fingerd of that [era](http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=4.3BSD/usr/src/etc/fingerd.c):

```c

main(argc, argv)
	char *argv[];
{
	register char *sp;
	char line[512];
	struct sockaddr_in sin;
	int i, p[2], pid, status;
	FILE *fp;
	char *av[4];

	i = sizeof (sin);
	if (getpeername(0, &sin, &i) < 0)
		fatal(argv[0], "getpeername");
	line[0] = '\0';
	gets(line);
	sp = line;
    // ... snip ...
    // build sp into arguments for finger and call /usr/ucb/finger via execv
    // putchar the result back to stdout
	return(0);
}

```


If you have experience with reading C code[^code], you may have spotted the
vulnerability. `gets(line)` reads STDIN and puts the contents into a 512 byte
buffer. This means that sending more than 512 bytes will overwrite the stack
with an attacker-controlled value.

The worm sent 536 bytes of data, which overwrote the
[stack frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack#Stack_and_frame_pointers)
of the `main` function. This allowed Morris to overwrite the pointer to where
`main` is returning to. He set that pointer to be *within* the 536 byte buffer
he sent over the network. The beginning of the buffer contained
[shellcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellcode) that called `/bin/sh`.

# Aftermath

Robert Tappan Morris was convicted and sentenced to three years probation, 400
hours of community service and a $10,050 fine (about $20,000 in today's dollars)
plus the cost of his supervision. He then went on to found a little startup
called Viaweb with Paul Graham and Trevor Blackwell. After being acquired by
Yahoo, the three of them went on to start Y Combinator with Jessica Livingston.
Today, Morris is a tenured professor at the Computer Science and Artificial
Intelligence Laboratory at MIT. He's one of the leaders of the Parallel and
Distributed Systems Groups.

Why did the paranoia around BadBIOS make me think of the Morris Worm? If you read contemporary articles about the Morris Worm, they'll sometimes mention, but never emphasize who Robert Morris's father was. The [elder Robert Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Morris_(cryptographer)) just happened to be a computer security expert. While the younger Morris was writing his worm, the elder was serving as Chief Scientist at the NSA's National Computer Security Center! 

The Internet grew up a lot since 1988, and not just in size. In 2013, your computer acting strangely is obviously a NSA-written malware that lives in your BIOS and propagates over sound waves imperceptible to the human ear. In 1988, son of an NSA security executive infects 10% of the Internet with a worm that uses an exotic new exploitation technique called a buffer overflow and ... nothing.

Just to be clear, I'm not alleging any conspiracy between father and son, besides perhaps father making some calls after son's arrest. Buffer overflows were understood as a problem before 1988, though not widely. It seems like Morris was the first to use one maliciously though. The way the media narrative handled the NSA connection in 1988 just says a lot about how the world of the Internet changed in 25 years.

As for Dragos Ruiu, he's been quiet about badBIOS since 2013. I'm not sure what he's doing these days besides [CanSecWest](https://cansecwest.com/), but I like to imagine his playing the saxophone in his torn up apartment.

[^credible]: One of the things I wish that the security industry would do less of is blind appeals to authority, and I hate that I made one here. Unfortunately, I don't have the skills or time to make my own analysis of Ruiu's data, so I just have to trust the Thought Leaders on this one. 

[^internet]: The 60,000 computer-strong Internet was of course one many networks at the time. The Internet was the one that was global and used TCP/IP &mdash; the Internet protocols. There in lies the pedant's case against the [AP](https://twitter.com/APStylebook/status/716279065888563200) about capitalization of the word "Internet".

[^graham]: Disclosure time. Years after giving that quote, Paul Graham and
Robert Morris went on to found Y Combinator along with Jessica Livingston and
Trevor Blackwell. They are an investor in
[Appcanary](https://www.appcanary.com). Robert Morris and I have never met. We
did have the privilege of an office hours with Paul Graham, and in the interest
of full disclosure I will relay his advice: he loved the idea of Appcanary but
hated the name. He said "It's really too bad that it's taken, because Oracle
would be a great name for you! You know everything about every vulnerability..."


[^worm]: My favourite paper on the analysis of the worm is [With Microscope and Tweezers](http://denninginstitute.com/modules/acmpkp/security/texts/INTWORM.PDF) from MIT's Eichin and Rochlis. They spend a page passionately arguing that it's a virus by using a complicated appeal to the difference between lytic and lysogenic viruses with references to three separate biology textbooks!

[^shadow]: I assumed that `/etc/shadow` came about as a consequence of the Morris Worm, but it [seems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passwd#History) that it was originally implemented in SunOS earlier in the 80's, and then took 2 years after the Morris Worm to make it into BSD.

[^magic]: Exploits really are magic, and goes without saying that exploit users have chosen the [Left-Hand Path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-hand_path_and_right-hand_path) to wizardhood. If the [cover of SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) is to be believed, the Right-Hand Path is available through careful study of functional programming and Lisps. Perhaps this is the true reason why Morris and Graham were such effective collaborators.

[^code]: On the other hand, this C code is over 30 years old. When I ran it through the gcc on my machine, I was very happy to see that it complained bitterly but still compiled it. One exercise for the reader is where the network operation actually happens. `main` takes input and output from STDIN/STDOUT, but there's an uninitialized `struct sockaddr_in sin` that we call `getpeername` on. How is a network socket piped to standard input/output and who is initializing the `sin` struct? I actually haven't been able to figure this part out. If you know, please tell [me](mailto:max@appcanary.com)! The full code listing is [here](http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=4.3BSD/usr/src/etc/fingerd.c).
